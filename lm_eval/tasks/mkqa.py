MKQA: Multilingual Knowledge Questions & Answers
https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15207

This open-domain QA answering evaluation dataset conists of 10,000 question-answer pairs sampled from the Google Natural Questions dataset (https://github.com/google-research-datasets/natural-questions). It has been developed to provide a benchmark for QA quality estimation across a wide set of languages.
